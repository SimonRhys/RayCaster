# RayCaster - Final Year Project

The goal of this project is to see if I can create a Real-Time RayCasting rendering engine, possibly with elements of RayTracing if time allows. The 'official' project description is below: 

*The overall aim is to replace the rendering engine with a rendering engine for human perceptual awareness and evaluate various different non-optically correct rendering modes and judge their effect on human perception. The basic version of this project will simply be about getting the raycasting engine to work and document how to change it further and study the impact on performance. A more advanced and challenging version of the project is to include some of the perceptual rendering effects in the rendering engine.*
