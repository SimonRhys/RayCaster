# RayCaster - Final Year Project

The goal of this project is to see if I can create a Real-Time RayCasting rendering engine, possibly with elements of RayTracing if time allows. The 'official' project description is below: 

*The overall aim is to see whether it is possible to utilise the GPU for raycasting calculations in order to create a real-time raycasting rendering engine. The basic version of this project will simply be about getting the raycasting engine to work and document how to change it further and study the impact on performance. From there it will be expanded to include loading of more complex models and incorporate some raytracing techniques such as reflection*
